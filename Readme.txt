1. For Monte Carlo simulations: A complete simulation with full sample size and iteration steps could take a while. Please use "Showcase.R" to run a small-scale Monte Carlo experiment. For replication of the results, please use "Replica.R" to extract the files from the folder Replica.
2. For application: K denotes the dimension of VAR model. In order to increase the readability of the code, I did not put “set.seed” all over the place. For 100%-replication of the results, please use “set.seed(1234)”.
3. All involved functions are collected in the local package “Functions”.
