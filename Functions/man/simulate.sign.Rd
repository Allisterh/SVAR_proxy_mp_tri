\arguments{
\item{Data}{List containing simulated data}

\item{AOA}{List generated by function AOA.3d()}

\item{Iter}{Integer, number of rotations}

\item{Itermax}{Integer, number of maximum draws}

\item{Signmat}{Matrix, a (KxK) matrix containing Sign restrictions. 1: positive sign; -1: negative sign; NA: unrestricted}

\item{TrueSign}{Matrix, a (KxK) matrix containing the true Sign pattern in DGP 1: positive sign; -1: negative sign}

\item{RHorizont}{Integer, RHorizonts of impulse responses, for which the sign restrictions are imposed}

\item{MT}{Logical, if MT = TRUE, Fry and Paganâ€™s (2011) median target (MT) method will be used}

\item{PositiveDiag}{Logical, if PositiveDiag = TRUE, the diagonal of impact matrix will be forced to be positive}

\item{Ci}{Double, between [0,1] sample quantiles for IRFs}

\item{Varname}{Character, names of variables in the systems}

\item{Bmat}{Matrix of dimension (KxK), the true structural decomposition implied by the DGP}

\item{Plot}{Logical, if Plot = TRUE, a plot of identification performance will be created#' @param Subsample Vector, a (1x2) vector containing start- and end-point of subsamples that will be
subject to estimation and identification}

\item{Hist}{Logical, if Hist = TRUE, histogram of distribution of freqencies of detecting the correct sign for the unrestricted elements in the identified B matrices is provided}
